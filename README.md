- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, good to see you here. Iâ€™m Ilay, known online as Statchy or Kof Meonen (depends on where you'd see me)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creation. Anything from art, music to video games, I want to do it all. For now, I mainly focus on video game developing, taking one leap at a time.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to make my own indie game, mainly in Unity.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My all time favorite game and the reason I decided to take this path in my life is Outer Wilds!
